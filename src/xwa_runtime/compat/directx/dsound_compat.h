/* Port-owned DirectSound compatibility shim.
 *
 * The recovered XWA audio code (flight SFX, frontend UI sound, and the iMUSE
 * music engine) was ported to call DirectSound COM objects through their
 * vtables. This shim provides those objects with real C vtables laid out at the
 * exact DirectSound ABI indices, backed by the generic Aeron mixer. It is the
 * single replacement for dsound.dll / A3D: recovered code keeps issuing the
 * same vtable calls, and this layer translates them into Aeron clips, voices
 * and streams.
 *
 * HRESULT convention: methods return 0 (DS_OK) on success and a negative value
 * on failure, matching the original `result >= 0` success tests. */
