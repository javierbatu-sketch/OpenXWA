 * OpenXWA application presentation contract.

 * The presentation frame is the application-logical coordinate space Aeron
 * composites layers and maps input in. Its height is fixed; its width tracks
 * the host window aspect (XwaPresentation_SyncToWindow) so the frame covers
 * the whole display at any aspect ratio. Classic 640x480 content is
 * aspect-fitted into the frame — pillarboxed or letterboxed, never stretched.
 * These coordinates are deliberately independent of both the classic drawing
 * space and physical GPU render-target sizes.
